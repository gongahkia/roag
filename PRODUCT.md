# Jomon Product Constraints

Jomon is a turn-based roguelike about sending one member of a persistent vessel-household into dangerous medieval settlements and wilderness. A courier trades, investigates, negotiates, and fights under pressure, then returns—or fails to return—with consequences that reshape Jomon, its people, and the local world.

The current product is a fullscreen Python 3.11 terminal game using the standard-library `curses` module. Its playable slice sends a prepared courier through a connected Hearthford settlement, looping Reedwood wilderness, and linear millworks with optional rooms. The courier faces a generated material problem, escalating visible pressure, distinct and mixed threats, discoveries, and situated material interactions before physically returning or suffering a contextual outcome that persists. A bounded visiting merchant can turn prior outcomes into later build choices.

The permanent constraints are:

- seeded, inspectable determinism and action-driven time;
- one directly controlled courier at a time, with a persistent household and physical Jomon;
- material cargo/resources and bounded local markets;
- injury, permanent death, succession, and contextual defeat;
- compact causal feedback and local offline persistence;
- keyboard-first ASCII play with accessible non-colour cues;
- original low-mysticism medieval content, with no copied lore, assets, or mechanics; and
- no sexual violence, slavery, torture, or harm/endangerment of children in authored or generated content.

Technical boundaries are equally permanent: new gameplay must remain local, deterministic, testable without initializing `curses`, and proportionate to its exercised state. The game targets Linux, macOS terminals, and Windows through WSL; uses Python's standard library only; and runs with `python -m jomon`. Do not add a web runtime, server, account, telemetry, database, multiplayer authority, wall-clock simulation, plugin framework, or public modding promise.

Prefer one primary game state, small dataclasses with actual gameplay state, direct action functions, one turn-resolution path, one atomic JSON save, authored content tables, small causal generators, and bounded significant history. Do not rebuild the browser-era event, replay, fidelity, provenance, dialogue, economy, or frontier frameworks in Python.

Depth should continue to come from room topology, readable enemy intent,
equipment/support/technique interactions, finite discoveries, and persistent
material consequences. Hearthford's three dedicated topology functions are a
bounded product feature, not the beginning of a generic generation toolkit.

`LORE.md` owns setting, tone, and content canon. `TODO.md` owns current scope and frozen work. The causal chain is documented in [`docs/causal-generation-and-loop.md`](docs/causal-generation-and-loop.md); browser history is recorded under [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/).
